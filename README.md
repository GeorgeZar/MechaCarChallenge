# MechaCarChallenge

Introduction:
We will assist Jeremy and the data analytics team with the following tasks during this project. Determine which characteristics in the dataset predict the mpg of Mecha Car prototypes using multiple linear regression analysis. Compile a summary of the suspension coils' pounds per square inch (PSI) data from the production lots. T-tests should be run to see if the manufacturing lots deviate significantly from the average population. Create a statistical analysis to compare the Mecha Car. Cars performance to that of other manufacturers' vehicles. We will produce a concise summary interpretation of the results for each statistical analysis.

Objectives:
We have some important objectives to cover in this Project and those are as follow.
•	Linear Regression to Predict MPG.
•	Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils.
•	T-Test on Suspension Coils.
•	Design a Study Comparing the Mecha Car to the Competition.

Conclusions:
Subsequent to figuring out which variables are key for the Mecha Car's class.
Invalid Theory (Ho): Mecha Car is valued accurately founded on its presentation of key elements for its type.
Elective Speculation (Ha): Mecha Car isn't valued accurately founded on the presentation of key variables for its class.
As we have performed all the three deliverables and we have concluded through codes and Outputs. We are now Well aware of this Auto Rus Project.
